Weatherbit API - https://www.weatherbit.io/api
Holiday API - https://holidayapi.com/


#Introduction:
Our team's initial plan for project 1 was to create a modular web app, with each team members focusing on creating a specific module at first, to allow us to create a huge project without a lot of maneuvering between team members. The idea of a roommate management system came first, as it had a lot of opportunity for us to build things geared for, and was a useful and realistic goal.


#Features:

-Event calender with syncing holidays (Only past, not paying that $10 a month API money for current holidays)

-Firebase stored event adder

-Randomly generated events from the bored API(Don't know what to do?)

-An up-to-date weather tracker for the house

-A bill payment system that allows you to enter bills and due date that stores in firebase

-A full on add/remove roommate system that actually changes the amount each roommate pays, depending on number of users

-Fully integrated and functional real-time chat system 

-Rudimentary, proof of concept, login system that could relatively easily be rigged up to firebase(stretch goal we didnt get to)

-Fully inegrated shopping list that stores in firebase
